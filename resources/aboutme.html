<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
    Hello! I'm a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Machine
    Learning engineer who is passionate about learning and
    thinking creatively to solve challenging problems.

<p>
    I think there is amazing potential to reshape the world with
    AI and I am dedicated to make this a positive impact. I want
    to become an expert in this field and in deploying fast
    solutions to people who can really benefit from it.

    When I'm not at my computer I'm likely climbing, break dancing
    or sharing experiences with the inhabitants of a different time
    zone.
